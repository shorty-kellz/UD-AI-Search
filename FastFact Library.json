    "summary": "September 10, 2023 Background for FF #1 Some deg ree of loss of cognitive function occurs in most patients in the week or tw o before death (1,2). The typical scenario presented to housesta ff is a late-night call from a ward nurse saying, E2809C Mr. Jones is confused, what should we do ?E2809D This Fast Fact reviews assessment and management issues in terminal delirium. See& nbsp; Fast Fact #60 for additional discussion of p harmacological treatments of delirium. Delirium Terminology: The term E2809Cconf usionE2809D is not an accurate descriptive termE28094it can mean anyt hing from delirium, dementia, psychosis, obtundation, or encephalopathy.&nb sp; Delirium can be characterized by a hyperactive/agitated&n bsp; state, a hypoactive state, or a mixture of the  two. The hallmark of delirium is an acute change in mentation and attention with either disorganized thinking, easy distractibility, or a fluctuating  level of consciousness. It is often accompanied by perception disturbances  with illusions, delusions or hallucinations.  E2809CTerminal deliriumE2809D is not a distinct diagnosis, although i t is a commonly used phrase. It implies delirium in a patient in the final  days/weeks of life, where treatment of the underlying cause is impossible,  impractical, or not consistent with the goals of care (3,4). Delirium Assessment (1-5): Patients need a f ocused assessment, including orientation to person, place, time, medical si tuation, and treatment options to better characterize confusion. Clinicians should use one of several validated delirium assessment tools to help quan tify and document cognitive function. See Fast Fact #160 .  Prevention and identifying the medical cause of delirium are usual ly the most effective means of reducing the morbidity from delirium. The ca use of delirium is usually multifactorial. In the hospital setting common c ulprits include infections (urinary, lung, gastrointestinal, etc) and medic ation, especially anti-cholinergics (e.g. anti-secretion drugs like scopola mine, anti-histamines, and tricyclic anti-depressants), sedative-hypnotics  (e.g. benzodiazepines), and opioids, and dopamine agonists (e.g. levo-dopa  or ropinirole) which may cause hallucinations and delusions. Met abolic derangements (abnormal sodium, elevated calcium, or low glucose or o xygen); CNS pathology, drug/alcohol withdrawal, uncontrolled pain, immobili ty, dehydration, and lack of sleep are other common contributors. &n bsp; The degree of clinical work-up to identify these causes of del irium is determined by understanding the disease trajectory and the overall goals of care (see Fast Fact #65 ). Non-Pharmacologic Treatments: These are the  mainstay in delirium management and should be utilized regardless of the ty pe of delirium (1-6). Alter the sensory stimulation in the environment as needed: for example , it may be best to turn off the television if the sounds are distracting o r confusing to the patient. Ask relatives/friends/familiar people to visit and reorient the patient to the medical situation. Perform frequent reminders of time/place/medical setting. The ABCDE (Awakening/Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring and Ea rly exercise/mobility) bundle has been used to prevent and manage delirium  in ICU settings (6). Pharmacologic Treatments: There is no clear  consensus about the role of medications to treat delirium. Antipsychotic me dications have long been used to treat delirium. An early, low-quality stud y in HIV patients with delirium suggested haloperidol, but not lorazepam wa s superior than placebo at managing delirium symptoms (7). However, subsequ ent research has not clearly shown that antipsychotics shorten the duration of delirium or reduce the agitation and morbidity associated with it (8-11 ). Interpreting the research is challenging, given that there are multiple  different antipsychotic agents available, a wide range of doses, various pa tient populations, different outcomes of interest, and unresolved questions about whether pharmacologic treatment should differ based on a hyperactive vs hypoactive delirium type. The following bullet points encapsulate the c hallenges in interpreting the evidence with regards to the pharmacologic tr eatment of delirium. A placebo-controlled trial (9) of inpatients in hospice or palliative c are unit settings and another placebo-controlled study (10) of patients in  an intensive care unit, found no significant difference with either ziprasi done or risperidone (second generation antipsychotics) or haloperidol (a fi rst-generation antipsychotic) in alleviating delirium symptoms, duration, o r severity. A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of lorazepam with s cheduled haloperidol vs scheduled haloperidol alone for agitated delirium a t the end of life (11) found that the addition of lorazepam significantly&n bsp; reduced agitation at 8 hours compared to haloperidol alon e. Despite this, two areas of consensus seem to remain. a. Hyperactive patients who are a danger to themselves or others (pulli ng out lines or tubes, striking caregivers, etc) despite behavioral and env ironmental modification, should be treated pharmacologically. Notably, ther e is no evidence-based drug approach to this, and reasonable treatment opti ons could include antipsychotics (especially if symptomatology includes hal lucinations or delusions), or sedatives such as benzodiazepines or dexmedet omidine if prognosis is felt to be short. b. Patients with terminal delirium should be treated pharmacologically  if it is the judgment of their caregivers that the delirium is a source of  suffering. In these circumstances, it is important to consider the therapeu tic goal in the context of the patientE28099s prognosis. If sedation is  acceptable, or even the goal in a dying patient, a sedating dose of a benzo diazepine or a sedating antipsychotic such as chlorpromazine is probably a  prudent approach even though such medications are known to cloud cognitive  clarity.",

    "title": "FF #124 The Palliative Prognostic Score | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "February 9, 2025 Background Accurate prognostic information is vital for patients, families, and clinicians. This Fast Fact reviews the Palliative Prognostic Score  (PaP); see Fast Fact #125 f or information on the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) and Fast Fact #444 for information on the Palli ative Prognostic Index (PPI). The PaP uses the Karnofsky Performance Score  (KPS) (see Fast Fact #416 ) and five other criteria to generate a numerical score from 0 to 17.5 wit h specific cutoff values to assign pati ents to three risk groups according to a 30-day survival probability  . Unlike m any other validated prognostic scales, a significant scoring weight is give n to the treating clinicianE28099s clinical prediction of survival (CPS) or E2809CgestaltE2809D prediction. Also, the PaP requires a full blo od count for calculation, something which may not always be performed in te rminally ill patients with comfort care goals (especially home and inpatien t hospice settings). < /p> Validation and use of the PaP  ; The PaP has been vali dated in large prospective studies in adult and pediatric oncology settings , as well as patients in inpatient hospices, inpatient palliative care unit s, and patients seen by palliative care consult teams. It has been shown to be reliable in various non-cancer diagnoses, but large-scale validation st udies have not been published. Variant of the PaP incl uding delirium (D-PaP) Since delirium has been shown to be a significant prognostic contribu tor, the D-PaP was developed to incorporate the clinical presence of deliri um. Patients receive 2 extra points if a clinician determines that delirium is present utilizing the CAM algorithm. The maximum score is 19.5 instead  of 17.5. In a retrospective analysis of terminally ill cancer patients, the D-PaP performed slightly better than the PaP. Variant of the PaP omitting CPS (PaP wit hout CPS) Since CPS is  by its nature a subjective assessment, the PaP without CPS was created whic h includes only the sum of the scores of the objective variables of PaP.&nb sp; The maximum score is 9 not 17.5. &nbs p; Comparative efficacy of the PaP There ar e a few retrospective and prospective studies comparing the PaP to other pr ognostic scoring systems (PPI, PPS, D-PaP, PaP without CPS) and even fewer  comparing PaP with clinician predication of survival (CPS) alone. The se studies suggest that the PPI, D-PaP, and PaP all identify classes of pat ients with different survival probabilities with good accuracy. The PaP and D-PaP may be slightly more accurate among cancer patients and they may be  more accurate than PaP without CPS or the CPS alone. However, larger studie s are needed to validate these findings. Also it is worth noting that the P aP only calculates a probability of a 30-day survival in patents with termi nal illness; many patients and families want a temporal prediction of how l ong they may have to live.",

    "title": "Constipation | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "January 28, 2019 Constipation ( FF #15) E28093 itE280 99s not fun to have or to treat. As with other symptoms, rational therapy  should be based on a sound understanding of underlying physiology. Our goal in treating constipation is generally not to E2809CcureE2809D someth ing, but to help the patient return to the best possible balance that will  allow a normal bowel movement to be passed. Four major components aff ect the production of a normal BM: solid waste, water, motility and lubrica tion. Solid Waste E28093 Too much or too little is a problem. The intestine is most efficient pushing intermediate volumes . Patients on fiber-poor diets may improve if fiber is added. Note: In pati ents on opioids or patients with minimal fluid intake or poor gut motility  (e.g. the dying patient) additional fiber can worsen the situation, causing a E28098soft impactionE28099. Water Content E28093 Stool water content depend s on how much water we drink, our general hydration status, how much water  is absorbed from and secreted into the intestine and how fast stool moves t hrough the bowel. Any of these variables can be manipulated. It is easiest  to limit absorption (and increase secretion into the gut) by adding osmotic ally active particles that retain water (e.g. Magnesium salts, non-absorbab le sugars such as sorbitol and lactulose, or polyethylene glycol [PEG]). No te: Magnesium and phosphorus salts are contraindicated in renal failure. Hy perosmolar solutions may worsen dehydration by drawing body water into the  gut lumen. Sickly-sweet sorbitol and lactulose may be difficult to fo r patients to tolerate. PEG is flavorless and may be better tolerated. Motility E28093 Patients with low-activit y levels (bed-ridden, dying patients and patients with advanced neurodegene rative disorders) and use of certain drugs (see below) lead to motility pro blems. Senna preparations, which stimulate the myenteric plexus are general ly favored. Use senna tablets (or granules, liquid, or tea), starting with  1 tab QHS, may be gradually increased to 4 tabs BID if needed. Before increasing motility, evacuate existing constipated stool with an enema or  cramping can result. Lubrication simply eases passage and minimizes pain that can interfere w ith excretion. Most commonly used is dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS, or docusate), which decreases stool surface tension much like soap. Usual dos age is 240 mg PO daily or BID. DSS also tastes like soap, so liquid DSS sho uld never be given PO, but may be given to tube-fed patients. Note: DSS is  commonly used in combination with senna in opioid-induced constipation, but is generally inadequate as a sole agent. Mineral oil can be used as an ene ma but should not be given PO, as pneumonitis can result if aspirated.  ; Glycerin suppositories can provide lubrication and draw-in water due to o smotically active particles. Medications that can cause/exacerbate constipation: Opioids, antic holinergics (tricyclic antidepressants, scopolamine, oxybutinin, promethazi ne, diphenhydramine), lithium, verapamil, bismuth, iron, aluminum, aalcium  salts. See Fast Facts #294 and #295 for more information on opioid induced  constipation.",

    "title": "Evaluating Requests for Hastened Death | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "October 21, 2024 Background for FF  #156 A patientE28099s request to a health care professiona l to help hasten death is not uncommon. The motivation for this request is  usually a combination of relentless physical symptoms, progressive debility , a loss of sense of self, loss of control, fear of the future, and fear of being a burden on others. Requests to hasten death are more common in thos e with a poor prognosis, a more recent diagnosis of a terminal illness, you nger age, higher socioeconomic status, and lower religiosity (1). Some clin icians are frightened by these requests, feeling that they are being asked  to cross unacceptable professional boundaries. Others may be tempted to qui ckly accede, imagining that they would want the same thing in the patient E28099s shoes. But requests for a hastened death may provide awareness i nto a patientE28099s experience of suffering and may lead to opportuniti es for more effective treatment if fully evaluated. In general, the clinici an should clarify, explore, evaluate, intensify treatment, and support the  patient to ensure a full understanding of the request and to ensure that al l alternatives have been considered before responding. This Fast Fact provi des guidance on how to evaluate and initially respond to a patient who rais es the topic of a hastened death. Fast Fact #159 will explore how to respon d when the request for a hastened death persists after a full evaluation an d search for alternatives. Clarify which question is being asked before respondin g. Is the patient expressing overwhelming psychological distress? Is the pa tient experiencing thoughts about ending his life (very common)? Is he/she  exploring the possibility of a hastened death in the future if their condit ion deteriorates? Is he/she exploring your willingness to assist right now  (e.g., Medical Aid in Dying) (2-4)? Support the patient and reinforce your commitment to t rying to find a mutually acceptable solution for the patientE28099s prob lem and to continue to work through the process. This does not mean violati ng fundamental values, but it does mean searching in earnest with the patie nt and family to find a way to approach the dilemma (5). Attend to your own support by discussing the patient with trusted colleagues and/or with your multidisciplinary team. Evaluate the patientE28099s decision-making capacit y. Is she seeing her medical condition clearly? Is the request proportionat e to the level of unrelieved suffering? Are there dominating aspects of anh edonia, worthlessness, and guilt, or is the capacity for pleasure and joy p reserved in some small ways? Is this request consistent with the patientE2 8099s past values? Get help from an experienced psychiatrist or psycholog ist if you are unsure (6). Explore the many potential dimensions that may contrib ute to the patientE28099s E2809CunbearableE2809D suffering to be s ure you (and the patient) fully understand its underlying cause(s). Sometim es in may be an unrelenting physical symptom, other times feelings of depre ssion, or a family or spiritual crisis, or perhaps a combination of many fa ctors (3,4). Respond to the associated emotions, which may be stron g and conflicted. Try to empathically imagine what the patient is going thr ough and asking for. Distinguish your own feelings and reactions from those of the patient. Intensify treatment of any potentially reversible elem ents of the patientE28099s suffering. Depending on the circumstances, of fer to increase treatment of pain or other physical symptoms, consider biol ogical or interpersonal treatment of depression; see if an appropriate and  acceptable spiritual counselor is available. Be creative and brainstorm pot ential solutions with your interdisciplinary team (3,4). Respond directly to the request for hastened death onl y after this multidimensional evaluation has been completed. If the patient has full decision-making capacity and all alternative approaches to the pa tientE28099s unbearable suffering have been fully considered, then re-ex plore exactly what is being requested, and look for mutually acceptable way s to potentially respond E28093 see Fast Fact #159 (7). Note that m any patients may be looking for the potential of an escape they will never  use, but a smaller number will be looking for a way to hasten death in the  present. Ask . Although many clinicians may be reticent to ask t heir patients about their desire to die, one study demonstrated no harm in  asking patients if they wished to hasten their death and in fact doing so w as associated with a temporary improvement in symptoms (8).",

    "summary": "October 21, 2024 Bac kground for FF #159 Requests for hastened death among terminally ill patients occu r commonly (see Fast Fact #156 ). With good symptom manageme nt, psychological and spiritual support, most patient requests do not persi st. This Fast Fact < span data-contrast3D\"auto\"> focuses on ways of responding to patients with persistent wishes for a hastened death despite every effort to find approp riate alternatives. This Fast  Fact does not address such requests by surrogate decision makers of patients who have lost decision-making cap acity. Reflect on your personal feelings about the request and discuss with ot her professionals. These case s are emotionally and ethically difficult. Brainstorm options with ot her members of the care team including physician colleagues, nurses, psycho logists, chaplains and others. Allow trusted colleagues to support yo ur emotional reactions. Seek out consultation/2 nd Opinion. Make sure you understand the medical, legal and ethica l issues involved in responding to a particular request for hastened death. Palliative care and/or ethics consultations are invaluable. In dependent second opinions may be helpful in clarifying the prognosis and en suring that all potentially effective therapeutic alternatives have been co nsidered. Learn the possibilities.  Possibilities are listed below from least to m ost ethically controversial. Considering these possibilities assumes that a ggressive measures to control physical, psychological and spiritual sufferi ng have been exhausted and/or rejected by the patient: Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. While mo st clinicians consider stopping invasive treatments under these circumstanc es (e.g. ventilators, ICDs, feeding tubes), simpler therapies such as insul in, antibiotics, oxygen, or steroids might also be voluntarily discontinued if they are prolonging life against the patientE28099s wishes. (Unlike  the other possibilities, there is widespread legal and ethical consensus ab out the permissibility of this response based on the right to bodily integr ity.) Voluntary withdrawal of oral intake. Patients may choose to stop eating and drinking to shor ten the dying process. Completely stopping oral food and liquids will typically result in death within two weeks. Sedation for severe intractable physical symptoms (see Fast Fact #106 < /span> and Fast Fact #107) . The intent of sed ation is to relieve intolerable suffering by a reduction in patient conscio usness. If artificial hydration and feeding are simultaneously  stopped, death will come within 1-2 weeks. Assisted Death (also  called assisted suicide ).  Assisted death is defined as someone who provides the means for another pe rson to end their life (e.g. prescribing an overdose amount of medication), but the patient is the one to decide if and when the medicine is actually  used, and the patient is responsible for taking the medicine. Assiste d death is illegal in the United States except for selected states (e.g. Or egon, Washington, Vermont, and Montana). Decision making process.  Have a detailed conversation regarding the risk and benefits of the differe nt possibilities that fit the patientE28099s clinical circumstances, and which the patient, family and you find ethically acceptable. Be as specifi c as possible, and document your thinking process clearly. Thus, if s topping eating and drinking is being considered, be sure everyone understan ds the importance of complete cessation of drinking or else the process can take months rather than weeks. Balance integrity and non-abandonment. It is not always possible to find common ground between the p atient and physician. When asked if one can support a particular act, a physician needs to be as specific as possible about what he/she can and  cannot do, and why. While the physician should not violate personal p rinciples to respond to a request he/she finds unacceptable, he/she should  search in earnest with the patient and family for alternative options that  might be mutually acceptable. Typically, this approach will allow the physician to maintain integrity while not abandoning the patient, even if  agreement on the particular act in question is not possible (1-4) .",

    "title": "Screening for ICU Delirium | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "October 21, 2024 Background for FF #160< /em> Delirium is an acute, fluctuating change in mental status, ac companied by sleep/wake cycle disruption, inattention, and altered percepti ons (hallucinations/delusions) (see Fast Fact #1 and Fast Fact # 60 ). Delirium can be hypoactive (25-44%), hyperactive (23%) , or a mix of both (52%) (1). Patients with hypoactive delirium are calm, b ut inattentive and manifest decreased mobility. Patients with hyperactive d elirium are agitated and combative and lack the ability to maintain attenti on to complete tasks. Delirium can be considered a marker of acute brain dy sfunction, much like shock is evidence for dysfunction of the cardiovascula r system (2). Like shock, if left unaddressed, delirium can is associated w ith a high mortality rate and significant distress. The cause of delirium i s often multifactorial. Once delirium is recognized, clinicians should revi ew the patient circumstance and treat potentially modifiable factors that c ontributed to the delirium (e.g., medications, volume depletion, infection) as feasible. This Fast Fact reviews commonly utilized screening tools for  delirium which can help clinicians more promptly identify delirium. ICU Delirium Delirium occurring in the ICU is associate d with an increased length of hospitalization, increased need for instituti onalization, and higher short and long-term mortality (3). In the ICU, deli rium occurs in as many as 80% of patients, but is often overlooked or misdi agnosed because of the difficulty of assessing mental states in intubated p atients. Three assessment tools have been described in the literature to ai d in delirium diagnosis. 1) The Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) Assessment Tool is the best documented method of diagnosing delir ium in the ICU (4). This tool was specifically designed for use in non-verb al (i.e. mechanically ventilated) patients. With the CAM-ICU, delirium is d iagnosed when patients demonstrate 1) an acute change in mental status or f luctuating changes in mental status, 2) inattention measured using either a n auditory or visual test, and either 3) disorganized thinking, or 4) an al tered level of consciousness. Importantly, the CAM-ICU can only be administ ered if the patient is arousable to voice without the need for physical sti mulation. The CAM-ICU includes very specific assessment questions/tools, fo und online at http://w ww.icudelirium.org/delirium.html . When administered by a trained medical professional, the CAM-ICU takes o nly 1 to 2 minutes to conduct (3,5). A systematic review of nine studies ev aluating the CAM-ICU showed a pooled sensitivity of 80% and a pooled specif icity of 95.9% for detecting delirium as compared to full DSM-IV assessment by a geriatric psychiatrist (6). National guidelines recommend routine use of the CAM-ICU for delirium assessment in all critically ill patients and  treatment with haloperidol when delirium is present (7). However, these rec ommendations are based on expert opinion and limited case series. It remain s unknown whether diagnosis and/or treatment of delirium will lead to bette r patient outcomes. While there are some early observational cohort data su ggesting that patients treated with haloperidol have lower hospital mortali ty, this finding needs confirmation in a randomized, controlled trial befor e being applied to routine patient care. 2) The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist asse sses eight features of delirium: altered level of consciousness, inattentio n, disorientation, hallucinations, psychomotor agitation/retardation, inapp ropriate mood/speech, sleep/wake cycle disturbance, and symptom fluctuation . The pooled sensitivity and specificity of this tool were 74% and 81.9% re spectively per a systematic review (6). 3) The Delirium Screening Checklist is another recent t ool that uses a checklist similar to the Intensive Care Delirium Screening  Checklist (8). Recommendation It is believed that prompt recognition a nd treatment of ICU delirium is important for patient safety. Use of rapid  tools such as CAM-ICU can help identify ICU delirium and are recommended wh en assessing mental status changes. A key to effective implementation of IC U delirium screening includes addressing attitudinal barriers that delirium is an inevitable part of critical illness via multi-faceted training such  as lectures, case-based scenarios, one-on-one teaching, and bedside teachin g to provide real time feedback (1).",

    "title": "FF #186 Anxiety in Palliative Care - Causes and Diagnosis | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "February 21, 2025 Bac kground Anxiet y is a state of apprehension and fe ar resulting from the perception of a current or future threat to oneself.& nbsp; The term is used to describe a symptom and a variety of psychiatric disorders in which anxiety is a salient symptom. This < i> Fast Fact will discuss the causes and evaluation of anxiety. Prevalence Anxiety is commonly reported in those fa cing life-threatening illnesses and yet clinicians frequently miss the diag nosis or symptom and report, mismanage the symptom, and report significant  training gaps in the management of anxiety. At least 25% and cancer p atients and 50% of CHF and COPD patients experience significant anxiety.&nb sp; At least 3% of patients with advanced cancer and 10% of COPD inpatients meet DSM criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (see below).  ; < /p> Etiologies Anxiety may be present as part of one of several p sychiatric disorders (see below). Anxiety is often a prominent component of acute or chronic pain, dyspnea, nausea, or cardiac arrhythmias. Adverse drug effects: corticosteroids, psychostimu lants, and some antidepressants. Drug withdrawal: alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines , nicotine, clonidine, antidepressants, and corticosteroids. Metabolic causes: hyperthyroidism and syndromes of adrenergic or serotonergic excess. Existential and psychosocial concerns about dying, prognostic awareness, disability, loss, legacy, family, finances, and reli gion/spirituality. Psychiatric disorders with anxiety as a  prominent symptom < span data-contrast3D\"auto\">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by perv asive and excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activitie s (such as work or school performance), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months. The anxiety and worry are associated with at least 3 of th e following 6 symptoms: restlessness, easy fatigue, difficulty concentratin g, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. < span data-contrast3D\"auto\">Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks. See Fast Fact #145 for its evaluation and management . < span data-contrast3D\"auto\">Adjustment disorder occurs within 3 months of a major stressor and causes marked d istress and functional impairment. Usually, it is characterized by a  depressed mood, but anxiety can also be its most prominent affective compon ent. < span data-contrast3D\"auto\">Acute- or post-traumatic stress disorders ( see Fast Fact #398 ) occur after an emotionally traumatic li fe-event and are characterized by anxiousness and arousal, as well as by nu mbness, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, and avoidance of stimuli which remi nd the patient of the trauma. < span data-contrast3D\"auto\">Phobias are marked, persistent fears brought about by specific situations or objec ts. Evaluation Anxiety as a symptom and as a disorder can be treata ble with the use of non-pharmacologic therapy (often employed by mental hea lth professionals) and/or pharmacotherapy. See Fast Fact < /a> #145 , Fast Fact # 211 , Fast Fact #309 , Fast Fact #46 5 , Fast Fact #466 for mo re on the treatment of anxiety. Therefore, it is important that all clinici ans who care for patients with serious illness garner skills in evaluating  for anxiety. Complete a thorough history and physical exam, as k about: Prior episodes or anxiety, depression, PTSD, alco hol, and drug use. Prior and current treatment by a mental health pr ofessional. Presence of specific trigger situations or though ts leading to anxiety. Presence of apprehension, dread, insomnia, and hy pervigilance; as well as physical symptoms such as diaphoresis, dyspnea, mu scle tension, and tremulousness. Seek help from a professional (e.g., primary care clinician, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker) familiar with anxiet y and how it is a prominent and functionally impairing part of a patientE2 8099s symptoms. Symptoms that can be confused with anxiety are ag itated delirium (see Fast Facts #1 and Fast Fact # 60 ), and akathi sia, an unpleasant sense of motor restlessness from dopamine-blocking medic ations such as antipsychotics and some antiemetics. Many medical conditions can cause symptoms mimick ing anxiety E28094 hyperthyroidism, autoimmune diseases, cardiac conditi ons, intoxication, hypercalcemia, adrenal insufficiency, etc. Perform a med ical work-up that is appropriate to the goals of care and prognosis when an xiety presents as a new symptom. Formal screening tools exist, but there is no con sensus on the benefit of their routine use. Commonly used tools which evaluate for anxiety as a symptom include the Edmonton Symptom Assessment  Scale, the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Hospice and Palliative Ca re Evaluation (HOPE) Symptom and Problem Checklist, and the Hospital Anxiet y and Depression Scale.",

Guided imagery is an intervent ion that can be delivered at the bedside in 10-15 minutes by a wide range o f trained health care providers at a low cost (1). This Fast Fact will disc uss guided imagery as an anxiety reduction technique. The Technique Guided imagery is a min d-body exercise based on prompting patients to formulate meaningful mental  pictures to achieve relaxation and reduce anxiety. Many guided imagery scri pts include common elements such as asking the patient to sit or lie in a c omfortable position, quieting the mind, removing negative thoughts and imag es, and calling to mind a vivid image or scenario that is calming and relax ing (a E28098safe placeE28099). The content of a guided imagery scrip t can include quiet and peaceful music with focus on a E2809Csafe place E2809D where one feels secure and relaxed or it may involve more active, physical sensations such as playing and winning a tennis match. It c an be performed by trained professionals or with the use of audio recording s, and can be performed daily or as needed by the patient. An example of la nguage used in a guided imagery exercise is: E2809CPosition yourse lf as comfortably as you can, shifting your weight so that youE28099re a llowing your body to be fully supported by your chair or couchE280A6.&nb sp; Take a deep, full, cleansing breathE280A6inhaling as fully as you ca nE280A6breathing deep into the belly if you canE280A6and breathing al l the way outE280A6. Imagine a place where you feel safe and peaceful an d easyE280A6a place either make-believe or realE280A6.E2809D  See reference (2) for an example of a full script. Further training  information about guided imagery can be found at http://academyforguidedima gery.com. Research Outcomes Guided imagery has  been shown to reduce anxiety and use of anxiolytics, and to improve patient satisfaction in a variety of medical settings (1, 3, 7). In separate studi es it was shown to significantly reduce anxiety and worry among patients fa cing abdominal surgery or cardiac catheterization compared to usual care (3 , 4). In a group of patients who had been hospitalized for more than  two days, use of anxiolytic medication and heart rate were lower in the gui ded imagery group than in a control group (5). A combination of diaphragmat ic breathing and guided imagery was used with a group of breast and gynecol ogical cancer brachytherapy patients using 10 minutes of face to face train ing and a follow-up taped script via audiocassette. Patients in the interve ntion group had significantly less anxiety at follow-up several weeks later than those in the control group (6). Clinical experience and expert  opinion support its helpfulness for advanced cancer patients, although ther e is little research yet in this population (8). Limits and Cautions While a saf e technique, guided imagery can rarely elicit negative emotional reactions, as well as create situations of patient vulnerability and susceptibility.& nbsp; Due to this, guided imagery should be initiated in health care settin gs by a clinician who is trained in its proper use, who is comfortable with professional therapeutic boundaries, and who can respond appropriately to  negative emotional reactions. In particular, guided imagery may trigg er flashbacks in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is re latively contraindicated in these patients. It is also contraindicate d in patients who have hallucinations or delusions, delirium, or severe obs essive compulsive disorder. As with any intervention, there are some patien ts who do not benefit from this technique or who are unable to call to mind a relaxing image.",

    "title": "FF #23 Discussing DNR Orders - Part 1 | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "April 29, 2025 Bac kground for Fast Fact #23 E28098Code statusE28099 discussions with seriously il l patients should always take place in the context of the larger goals of c are, using a step-wise approach. This Fast Fact introduces an approach  to having these discussions; Fast F act # 24 discusses disagreements about E28098code stat us. Fast Fact < span style3D\"color: #800080;\"> #365 provides more extensive scripting recommendatio ns for code status discussions for the average patient; Fast Fact #366 provides scripting for code status discussions for patients near the  end-of-life. Prior to any discussion of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, c linicians must know the data defining outcomes and morbidity of cardiopulmo nary resuscitation in different patient populations (see Fast Fact #179 ). 1. Establish the settin g. Ensure comfort and p rivacy; sit down next to the patient. Ask if family members or others shoul d be present. Introduce the subject with a phrase such as: E2809C  IE28099d like to talk with you about pos sible health care decisions in the future.E2809D 2. What does the patien t understand? An informed dec ision about DNR status is only possible if the patient has a clear understa nding of their illness and prognosis. Ask an open-ended question to elicit  patient understanding about their current health situation. It is imp ortant to get the patient talking E28093 if the doctor is doing all the  talking, it is unlikely that the rest of the conversation will go well.&nbs p; Consider starting with phrases such as: E2809C What do you understand about your current health situation? What have the doctors told you about your condition?E2809D If the patient does not know/appreciate t heir status this is time to review that information. 3. What does the patien t expect? Ask the patient to  consider the future. Examples of ways to start this discussion are E280 9C What do you expect in the future? E2809D or E2809C What goals do you have for the time you have left E28094what is important to you?E2809D This step allows you to listen while the patient describes a real or imagined future. Many patients with advanced disease use this open ing to voice their thoughts about dyingE28094typically mentioning comfor t, family, and home, as their goals of care. If there is a sharp disc ontinuity between what you expect and what the patient expects, this is the time to clarify. Listen carefully to the patientE28099s r esponses; many patients have thought a lot about dying, and only need permi ssion to talk about what they have been thinking. Setting up the conv ersation in this way permits the physician to respond with clarifying and c onfirming comments such as:  E2809CSo, what you E28099re saying is E28093 you want to be as comfortable as possible w hen the time comes? Or E28093 What youE28099ve said is E28093  you want us to do everything we can to fight, but when the time comes, you  want to die peacefully?E2809D Whenever possible, ask patients to explain the values that underlie the ir decisions: E2809C Can you expla in why you feel that way ?E2809D< /span> 4. Discuss a DNR order. Use language that the patien t will understand; give information in small pieces. DonE28099t in troduce CPR in mechanistic terms (e.g. E2809Cstarting the heartE2809D or E2809Cputting on a breathing machineE2809D). Never say E2809C< /span> Do you want us to do everything?E2 809D E2809CEverythingE2 809D is euphemistic and easily misinterpreted. Using the word E2 809CdieE2809D helps to clarify that CPR is a treatment that tries to r everse death. To most lay people, when the heart and/or lungs stop, t he patient dies. If the patient and doctor mutually recogniz e that death is approaching and the goals of care are comfort, then CPR is  not an appropriate medical intervention and a clear recommendation against  CPR should be made. You can say: We have agreed that the goals of care are to keep you comfortable and get you home. E2809CI do not recommend the use of CPR or a br eathing machine to try to prolong your dying process. If you agree with thi s, I will write an order in the chart that if you die, no attempt to resusc itate you will be made.E2809D If the clinical situation is more ambiguous in terms of prognosis and goals of care, and you have no clear recommendat ion, the issue of a code status order can be introduced by saying: E280 9C If a patientE28099s heart is n ot pumping blood, we sometimes attempt to restore life using cardiopulmonar y resuscitation or CPR. This means pushing on a patientE28099s chest wit h our hands to try to pump blood through the body, using electricity to sho ck a patientE28099s heart into beating properly again, and placing a tub e down a patientE28099s airway and attaching them to a ventilator machin e which breathes for them. Doing this does not always lead to survival or r ecovery, and some of my patients would rather we not attempt it, which is w hy I ask everyone about it.E2809D 5. Respond to emotions. Strong emotions are co mmon when discussing death. Typically, the emotional response i s brief. The most profound initial response a clinician can make may  be silence or a simple, empathetic acknowledgement of the patientE28099s response (see Fast Fact #29 ). 6. Establish a plan.&nb sp; Clarify the orders and plans th at will accomplish the overall goals you have discussed, not just the DNR o rder. A DNR order does not address any aspect of care other than prev enting the use of CPR. It is unwise and poor practice to use DNR status as  a proxy for other life-sustaining therapies. Consider using words: E280 9C We will continue maximal medical  therapy to meet your goals. However, if you die, we wonE28099t use CPR to bring you back.E2809D Or , E2809CIt sounds like we should  move to a plan that maximizes your comfort. Therefore, in addition to a DNR order, IE28099d like to talk further with you how we can best do  that.E2809D",

    "summary": "April 29, 2025 Int roduction for Fast Fact #24 The basic steps in the DNR discussion for serious ly ill hospitalized patients were described in Fast Fact #23 , Fast Fact # 365 , and Fast Fact # 366 . If you have followed those steps, what do you do if the patien t or family/surrogate continues to want CPR and you think it is not in the  patientE28099s best interest? The seemingly E28098unreasonableE280 99 request for CPR typically stems from one of several themes. Inaccurate information about CPR.  ; The public has an inflated  perception of CPR success. While most people believe that CPR works 60-85%  of the time, the actual survival to hospital discharge is more like 10-15%  for all patients, and less than 5% for the elderly and those with serious i llnesses. This is a time to review/clarify the indications, contraind ications, potential outcomes and morbidity of CPR. Start by asking,  E2809C What do you know about CPR? E2809D Hopes, fears, and guilt. < /span> Be aware that guilt (E2809C I havenE28099t lived nearby to care for my dying motherE2809D ) and fear (E2809C I am afraid to make a dec ision that could lead to my wifeE28099s deathE2809D ) are common motivating emotions for a persistent CPR request. Some patients or families need to be given an explicit reco mmendation, or permission to stop all efforts to prolong life, to be told t hat that death is coming and that they no longer must continue E2809Cfig htingE2809D. Whenever possible, try to identify the underlying emo tions and offer empathic comments that open the door to further conversatio n. E2809C This decision seems very hard for you. I want to give you the best medical care possible; I k now you still want CPR, can you tell me more about your decision?E2809D< /span> The moral burden of E28098choosing  to die.E28099 Agreeing to a DNR  order for some patients/families feels equivalent to them E2809Cchoosing E2809D to die, E2809Cgiving up.E2809D A patient may accept that th ey are likely to die, while also strongly feeling that it is their moral re sponsibility is to struggle against death and agreeing with a DNR order can feel like a betrayal of that obligation. Some patients see CPR as a E280 9Clast chanceE2809D for continued life. Probe with open-ended que stions: E2809C What do you expect  to happen? What do you think would be done differently, after the resuscita tion, that wasnE28099t being done before?E2809D Many patients describe hope for a new treatment. U se the opportunity to describe that you are doing everything in your power  to prolong their life before a cardiopulmonary arrest E28093 you wouldn E28099t be E2809Csaving somethingE2809D to do after they had died. If patients are not ready for a DNR order, donE28099t let it dist ract you from other important end-of-life care needs; emphasize the goals t hat you are trying to achieve; save a repeat discussion for a future time;  good care, relationship building, and time will help resolve most conflicts . Distrust of the medical care system.&n bsp; Patients or families may give you a clue that there is a fundamental distrust of doctors or the med ical system; this should be addressed openly . E2809CWhat you said makes me wonder if you may not have full trust in the doctors and nurses to do what is best for you? Can you tell m e about your concerns?E2809D Managing persistent requests for CPR.& nbsp; Decide if you believe t hat CPR represents a futile medical treatmentE28094that is, CPR cannot b e expected to either restore cardiopulmonary function or to achieve the exp ressed goals of the patient (see Fast Fact #136 ).  Clinicians are not legally or ethically obligated to participate in a futi le medical treatment, and some institutions have a policy that a clinician  may enter a DNR order in the chart against patient wishes. Certainly, many  institutions in the US do not have such policies. Aside from writing a DNR  order without patient or family agreement, other options include: Transfer care to another clinician chosen by the p atient/family (this should only be done rarely where there is an irreparabl e breach of trust between clinician and patient/family). Plan to perform CPR at the time of death E28093 but donE28099t end the discussio n . Engage the patient about her or  his wishes if they survive the resuscitation attempt. Tell the patien t that you need guidance because it is very likely that if she or he surviv es CPR, they will be on life support in the ICU, and they may not be able t o make decisions for themselves; ask them (or the family) to help you deter mine guidelines for deciding whether to continue life-support measures.&nbs p; If not already done, clarify if there is a legal surrogate decision-make r.",

    "title": "FF #274 The FICA Spiritual History Tool | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "March 4, 2019 Background Spiritu ality is defined as E2809Cthe aspect of humanity that refers to the way  individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experienc e their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to  the significant or sacredE2809D (1). Taking a spiritual history is an im portant patient assessment skill, and most patients report they want medica l professionals to be aware of the importance of religion or spirituality t o them (2). Fast Fact #19 presents one approach to taking a spiritual histo ry. This Fast Fact discusses the FICA Spiritual History ToolC2A9 (Faith,  Importance/Influence, Community, Action/Address). Spirituality & Health There is a large body of evid ence that demonstrates a relationship between spirituality, religion and he althcare outcomes (3-9). Spirituality and religion are strong contributors  to how people cope with illness and suffering (10-12). Providing for spirit ual and religious needs benefits both patients and the health care system ( 13). Spiritual History & the Healthcare Team A National  Consensus Conference (NCC) developed models and guidelines for interprofess ional spiritual care (1). While the conference highlighted the importance o f board-certified or board-eligible chaplains as the spiritual care experts and essential members of palliative care and other care teams, it recommen ded that all members of the health care team be responsible for addressing  patientsE28099 spiritual issues within the biopsychosocial-spiritual fra mework (14). The NCC recommended that all patients should have a spiritual  screening or history, that spiritual distress should be diagnosed and atten ded to, and that validated assessment tools should be used. Taking a Spiritual History E28093 Key Principles Consider spirituality as a potentiality important component of every pa tientE28099s life. Spirituality can impact a patientE28099s quality o f life; it is an inherent part of most peopleE28099s wellbeing. Address spirituality at each new visit, at annual examinations, and at  follow-up visits if appropriate. Respect a patientE28099s privacy regarding spiritual beliefs. Be aware of your own beliefs; donE28099t impose your spiritual/relig ious beliefs on others. Make referrals to chaplains, spiritual directors, or community resource s as appropriate. FICA The FICA Spiritual History ToolC2A9 was develope d to help healthcare professionals address spiritual issues with patients.  FICA serves as a guide for conversations in the clinical setting. It is als o used to help identify spiritual issues patients face, spiritual distress, and patientsE28099 spiritual resources of strength. The FICA tool has b een evaluated in cancer patients (15). This study suggests FICA is a feasib le tool for the clinical assessment of spirituality, and responses to the F ICA were correlated to many aspects of quality of life. Healthcare professi onals are encouraged not to use the FICA tool as a checklist, but rather to rely on it as a guide to aid and open the discussion to spiritual issues.< /p> F E28093 Faith, Belief, Meaning E2809CDo you cons ider yourself spiritual or religious? Do you have spiritual beliefs that he lp you cope with stress?E2809D If the patient responds E2809CNo,E2 809D the health care provider might ask, E2809CWhat gives your life me aning?E2809D It is important to contextualize these questions to the rea son for the visit E28093 e.g., wellness, stress management, breaking bad news, the end of life.

    "title": "FF #294 Opioid Induced Constipation - Part 1: Established Management | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "March 4, 2019 Background Opioid induced constipatio n (OIC) affects 45-90% of patients (1, 2) and can cause significant morbidi ty. It is the most common reason patients avoid and/or discontinue opioids  (3, 4) and can often result in an increase in hospital length of stay (5) a nd overall healthcare costs (6). This Fast Fact will describe the physiolog y of OIC and describe established treatment strategies. Fast Fact # 295 wil l discuss newer management strategies. Physiology OIC is mediated through se veral different mechanisms including ineffective GI motility, inhibition of mucosal transport of electrolytes and fluids, and interference with the de fecation reflex (7). The greatest risk factor for developing OIC is duratio n of opioid therapy. Route of delivery or increased opioid dosing does not  appear to affect the risk of developing OIC (2). While patients usually dev elop tolerance to most other side effects from opioids, they do not develop tolerance to OIC (1). Non-pharmacologic Therapies Phys ical activity, scheduled toileting, fiber, and adequate fluid intake have b een traditional non-pharmacologic mainstays for preserving GI regularity in constipation (8). However, there is no specific evidence in favor for any  of these interventions to treat OIC and adherence may be challenging for ch ronically ill patients. Pharmacologic Therapies In general, p atients with regular opioid exposure will require pharmacologic therapy to  appropriately manage OIC. Both stimulant and osmotic laxatives have s hown to be effective in treating OIC and are considered the cornerstone of  treatment. Failure of oral pharmacologic therapy usually requires more inva sive rectal based interventions or one of the newer treatment modalities (s ee Fast Fact #295). Stimulant Laxatives: Senna and bisacodyl are the main stimulant laxativ es available in the US and work by increasing enteric muscle contraction an d GI motility. The onset of action for oral senna and bisacodyl is around 6 -12 hours. Starting dose for senna is two 8.6 mg tabs; bisacodyl is one 10m g tab. However, higher doses are usually needed for OIC. Senna can be safel y dosed up to 12 tabs daily and bisacodyl up to 30 mg (9). Both medications are relatively inexpensive. Because stimulant laxatives cause intestinal c ontractions their use can be limited by abdominal cramps and pain. This can sometimes be avoided by dividing the total dose into smaller more frequent doses (9). Osmotic Laxatives: These include non-absorbable sugar molecules such as polyethelyne glycol (PEG), lactulose, and sorbitol, as well as poorly abso rbed salt-based molecules like milk of magnesia and magnesium citrate. Osmo tic laxatives have limited intestinal absorption leading to an increase in  colonic intraluminal water through oncotic pressure. With increased intralu minal volume and distension, reflex peristalsis subsequently occurs. Additi onally, the increase in intraluminal water also leads to softer stool and a llows for easier intestinal transit. The starting daily dose for PEG is 17  g, for lactulose is 15 ml, and 30 ml for 70% sorbitol solution. Osmotic lax atives will have a linear effect on bowel function with dose increases; the maximum effective daily dose of PEG is 68 g (10), lactulose is 60 ml, and  for sorbitol is 150 ml. The onset of action for osmotic laxatives tends to  be variable ranging from 12 to 48 hours, but when used regularly patients w ill have a more consistent effect. Osmotic laxatives generally do not lead  to a loss of fluids or electrolytes as they only bind to orally taken fluid . With this, PEG requires 125 ml of fluid per 17 g dose (11) and similarly  ~200 ml is recommended with every 30 ml of lactulose (12). Major side effec ts from osmotic laxatives include abdominal cramping, pain, and flatulence. Lactulose and sorbitol tend to have more of these side effects than PEG (1 1). While sorbitol and lactulose have shown similar efficacy, sorbitol tend s to be more cost effective (13). Magnesium based compounds (milk of magnes ia and magnesium citrate) are also effective, but the magnesium load can be dangerous for patients with renal insufficiency. Rectal Based Laxatives: Unfortunately, there is a lack of clinical rese arch to support rectal based laxatives, but anecdotally they are often used for refractory constipation. Stimulant suppositories such as bisacodyl and rectal vault lubricants such as glycerin are inexpensive. Their onset is u sually within 10-15 minutes and can be dosed daily (9). Warm tap water and  milk of molasses enemas (12) can be dosed more frequently (up to every two  hours). They work by causing rectal distension and reflex defecation. Other enema formulations, such as phosphate or saline enemas, should be used wit h caution in renal insufficiency due to concern for electrolyte shifts. Manual Evacuation: Digital stimulation and manual disimpaction may be n ecessary if fecal impaction is suspected. Due to the discomfort associated  with manual evacuations, these are often interventions of last resort and m ay require pre-medication with pain medications and/or anxiolytics. Ineffective Therapies: Docusate sodium not demonstrated efficacy in ran domized controlled studies for OIC compared with placebo (14). Bulk forming laxatives (psyllium or fiber) require at least 1.5 L of water to be effect ive and can actually lead to worsened constipation with inadequate fluid in take. Consequently, most guidelines do not routinely recommend their use (1 1,15,16). Practical Advice A consistent bowel r egimen is essential in preventing constipation in patients on chronic opioi d therapy. Providers should educate their patients about the signs and symp toms of OIC and seek appropriate consultation in a timely manner. A s cheduled stimulant laxative regimen such as Senna 2 tabs twice daily should be prescribed at the onset of regular opioid use regardless of opioid dosi ng. The goal for the bowel regimen should be an unforced bowel movement at  least every other day. If a patient has not had a bowel movement in 48 hour s, increasing stimulant laxative dose and/or adding an osmotic laxative is  appropriate. Failure of oral laxative therapy usually requires rectal based interventions and/or one of the newer treatment modalities (see Fast Fact  #295).",

    "title": "FF #295 Opioid Induced Constipation - Part 2: Newer Therapies | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "March 4, 2019 Background Fast Fact #294 introduces  OIC and discusses well-established treatments. This Fast Fact discusses eme rging management approaches. In general, these agents are used for refracto ry OIC, which implies persistent and distressing symptoms despite exposure  to typically effective doses of stimulant and osmotic laxatives. When exactly to use these emerging therapies remains largely empiric. Opioid Antagonists Since the majority of symptoms associated with OIC are secondary to stimulation of C2B5-opi oid receptors in the gut, opioid antagonists offer an attractive pharmacolo gic rationale for OIC (1). Naloxone: Until recently, naloxone was the only av ailable opioid antagonist for OIC treatment. Typically, patients orally ing est the contents of IV ampules. Naloxone has a high first pass metabolism,  so it is possible for patients who take it orally to have peripheral C2B5 -opioid receptor antagonism without significant impact on central receptors which could lead to opioid withdrawal and loss of analgesia (2). In a smal l, non-controlled study, 80% of chronic opioid users had bowel evacuation i n 1-4 hours after naloxone administration. Unfortunately, over two-thirds r eported a 10-15% loss of analgesia and nearly one-third had withdrawal symp toms (3). Therefore, if used, it is recommended to start at a low dose of 0 .8 mg twice daily. Effective doses typically need to be at least 10% of equ ivalent daily morphine dose, so naloxone usually requires slow up-titration with max dosing of 12 mg daily (2). Methylnaltrexone bromide: Methylnaltrexone is a pe ripherally-acting C2B5-opioid receptor antagonist. It is a methylated for m of naltrexone and formulated as a subcutaneous injection. It is less able to cross the blood brain barrier, reducing the risk of altering analgesia  or inducing central opioid withdrawal. An industry-funded randomized contro lled trial of chronic opioid users showed that weight based methylnatrexone dosing led to laxation in nearly half of subjects within 4 hours as oppose d to 15% of placebo (4). A subsequent meta-analysis of 6 separate trials wi th methylnaltrexone demonstrated the number needed to treat (NNT) is 3 for  OIC patients that have failed to respond to standard laxative therapy (5).  Its use is limited by cost which averages $55 per dose, and it is also cont raindicated when bowel obstruction is suspected or for patients with compro mised bowel integrity. The most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, a nd cramping E28093 which can be severely painful. Naloxegol: Two oral peripheral acting C2B5-opioi d receptor antagonists are available in the US: alvimopam, which is only ap proved for post-operative ileus, and naloxegol (pegylated naloxone), which  has recently been approved for OIC in non-cancer patients. Two separate pha se-three clinical trials showed an increase from 1 to >3 bowel movements per week in non-cancer patients on chronic opioids with daily dosed naloxe gol compared to placebo. There was also a significant improvement in a subs et of patients who had failed traditional laxative therapy as well (7). Bot h 12.5 mg and 25 mg have been studied; the 25 mg dose has a higher success  rate but is associated with more abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarr hea (7). Its current price is approximately $300 for 30 pills.  &nb sp; Other Agents Lubiprostone: Lubiprostone is a selective c hloride channel-2 activator that acts locally on the small intestine to inc rease fluid secretion and GI motility. It is FDA approved for OIC. Two rand omized controlled trials in non-cancer chronic opioid users demonstrated an increase in frequency of spontaneous bowel movements by week 8. More over, approximately 40% of subjects had a bowel movement at 24 hours, 60% w ithin 48 hours, and 27% of subjects had > 3 bowel movements per week (8, 9). The most studied dose is 24 mcg orally twice per day. Common side effec ts included nausea, diarrhea and abdominal distension. Curiously, lubiprost one does not appear to be effective for methadone induced constipation (10) . Linaclotide has a different mechanism than lubiprostone, but is also a small intestinal secretogogue. It currently is approved for irri table bowel syndrome. Though there is interest in its efficacy in OIC, it h as yet to be specifically studied in this population. Prucalopride is a serotonin receptor type-4 agonist which is available in Canada and parts of Europe and Asia to treat chronic constipation.  ; It is a prokinetic agent which has shown promise for treating OIC in a ph ase 2 study (5). It is unclear if or when it will be released in the US. Practical Advice Traditional or al and rectal laxatives have been the mainstay of treatment in OIC for many years. However, recent development of novel approaches to treat OIC show p romise for the future. Of the pharmacologic interventions described above,  methylnatrexone has been the best studied and shown to be the most efficaci ous. It is reasonable to give methylnaltrexone after failure of oral laxati ves (see Fast Facts #294) in OIC, and potentially can be used prior to usin g more invasive rectal based interventions. With time and more clinical tri als, other oral formulations targeting OIC may become more standard of care . Patient and caregiver education about the importance of adherence to reco mmended therapy and guidance about signs and symptoms of OIC is essential t o ensure effective treatment.",

    "title": "FF #365 Language for Routine Code Status Discussions | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "June 26, 2019 Background Discussions ab out resuscitation orders are often complex and emotional. Additionally, the re are different contexts of code status discussions such as routine discus sions with patients upon hospital admission who are at low-risk of in-hospi tal arrest vs discussions with patients with advanced illnesses who are hig hly unlikely to survive an in-hospital arrest. Discussing code status can b e challenging during an initial encounter with a patient because clinicians often do not have enough time or information to fully understand the under lying medical situation nor the patientE28099s values. It is our e xperience that many clinicians struggle to find accurate, concise, and comp assionate language when leading these discussions on an initial encounter a nd skip it entirely or ask euphemistic questions which fail to educate the  patient on the very basics of what is at stake (e.g., asking Do you wan t us to do everything? ). This Fast Fact , and Fast Fact #3 65 , suggest language for clinicians when having these conversations.&n bsp; These are not meant to be verbatim scripts , but rather exampl es that clinicians can use for teaching or personal adaption. Additional Fast Facts that address code status discussions include #23, #24, #1 79, and #292. Routine code status discussions upon hospital admission  It is common practice and institutional policy that adult pa tients are asked about code status upon admission to the hospital, regardle ss of their underlying condition and prognosis (1). These discussions can b e frightening for the patient (e.g. the patient worries that the clinician  is introducing the topic because the patientE28099s prognosis is worse t han they have been led to believe). The following tips are meant for patien ts with good or uncertain prognoses, for whom you think a E28098full cod eE28099 order is reasonable and medically appropriate. Any prior out-of- hospital orders for life-sustaining treatments or healthcare directives sho uld be reviewed prior to this discussion. Typically, it is best to have thi s discussion towards the end of the admission process, after discussing the plan and expectations for a patientE28099s hospital admission. Normalize & contextualize the d iscussion : I have one more topic to discuss with you. It is so mething I discuss with every patient I am admitting to the hospital, regard less of how healthy or sick they are. Some of my patients have strong opini ons about this, and it is important I know what they are so I can make sure that I respect their wishes. Provide basi c definitions : ItE28099s about something we call your E2 8098code statusE28099 or E28098resuscitation orders.E28099 This  means directions to your medical team about what we should or shouldnE280 99t do if you were to unexpectedly become very ill and your heart stopped  beating while you were here. Hand the conversati on to them . What have you heard about the term E28098code s tatusE28099 or E28098resuscitation ordersE28099? Patients oft en respond helpfully to this question and you quickly get a sense if they k now what you are talking about or not. If they have clear wishes abou t their own code status, they often readily provide them. It can also help you identify their emotional readiness to continue the conversation. Emoti ons are an expected part of this conversation, and it is critical to explor e any strong reaction to understand the emotions or values that underlie it . Empathize, normalize, partner, and reassure . I know this can be upsetting to discuss. OrE28094 No one  wants to think about this possibility. OrE28093 I want you to kn ow I donE28099t think itE28099s likely weE28099ll be facing this.< /em> For patients who have adequate context for the discussion and  voice a code status choice, thank them for the discussion and educate them  as to how your institution designates code status. Educate  patients who need more context . A simple, explicit explanation, av oiding euphemisms, is adequate for most patients. Present cardiopulmonary r esuscitation as a package of interventions, and not a menu of options.  What I am talking about is what we do if a patient becomes critically ill i n the hospital and we are worried they might die. If a patientE28099s he art is not pumping blood, we sometimes attempt to restore life using cardio pulmonary resuscitation or CPR. This means pushing on a patientE28099s c hest with our hands to try to pump blood through the body, using electricit y to shock a patientE28099s heart into beating properly again, and placi ng a tube down a patientE28099s airway and attaching them to a ventilato r machine which breathes for them. Doing this does not always lead to survi val or recovery, and some of my patients would rather we not attempt it, wh ich is why I ask everyone about it. Wait for the ir response . As appropriate, provide additional information about  what CPR & critical illness entail, in-hospital CPR outcomes (see F ast Fact #179), or what care for a patient who has a DNR order looks l ike if they become critically ill. Many patients will be surprised to learn of the poor survival outcomes of in-hospital arrests and want to discuss t his further. You might say Overall the changes of someone surviving CPR is about 1 in 7 . Some people are willing to go through all the me dical treatments and being on a ventilator machine for that chance. Others  say E28093 If the chances are that low, I would not be willing to do tha t. Can you tell me about the kind of person you are? There are situations in which intubation ma y need to be considered for patients who have not suffered an arrest such a s in the case of progressive respiratory failure. Patient outcomes fo r invasive mechanical ventilation alone are much better than those for in-h ospital cardiac arrest. This should be discussed and clarified when appropr iate. Let the patient know the discussion may b e revisited as you get a better understanding of their medical sit uation. I will update your chart to reflect our discussion. As we under stand more about your medical situation, I may ask to talk with you about y our code status again.",

    "title": "FF #379 Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking in the Terminally Ill | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "June 26, 2019 Bac kground Vol untary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED) is defined as a competent ind ividual deciding to stop taking hydration and nutrition with the intention  of hastening death. VSED is conceptually different from the loss of appetit e and markedly diminished oral intake that occurs in the context of a progr essing terminal illness, as well as diminished oral intake due to a psychia tric disease such as anorexia nervosa. Although controversial, VSED b y terminally ill patients is seen by some as an ethical alternative to medi cal aid in dying (MAID) (1) and will be discussed in this Fast Fact . Epidemiology How often VSED occurs is unknown. A few studies ha ve tried to measure its prevalence, however all the data come from surveyin g clinician or caregiver recollection, which is subject to bias and overloo ks the possibility that patients participate in VSED without a medical clin ician ever knowing. In a hospice nurses, 40% recalled caring for a VSED pat ient (2). A review in the Netherlands estimated 2.1% of deaths were by VSED , although this is based on low-quality data (3). In one survey, Dutch phys icians reported a median time from stopping eating/drinking to death of 7 d ays (4). Symptom Burden of VSED The little data that exist suggest that  VSED is not associated with any unique end-of-life symptom burden. Pain, dr y mouth, thirst, dyspnea, and agitation/delirium are commonly reported (2,3 ). Of note, hunger is not listed as a common symptom. Apart from being mind ful to minimize unnecessary fluid administration via enteric elixirs or par enteral meds, symptom management is the same as with other dying patients.< /span> Ethical, Legal, and Practical Concerns VSED is broadly considered to be different ethica lly and legally than MAID. While they have similarities, fundamentally MAID requires a clinician directly assisting a patient hastening their death, w hereas VSED can be completed without any clinician involvement or knowledge . VSED in terminally ill patients is also considere d by many to be ethically different than suicide. While individuals have a  right to refuse medical treatment, this is not absolute, and a medically he althy individual who stops eating and drinking because of a psychiatric ill ness could be committed and have psychiatric treatment and medical nutritio n forced upon them. This is because of societyE28099s interest in protec ting life, and the fact that many people, with adequate psychiatric care, w ill recover. VSED is different. First, many terminally ill patients partici pating in VSED are not psychiatrically ill E28093 there is no E28098u nderlying mental illnessE28099 to be treated. Additionally, confining an d forcing artificial nutrition against the will of a terminally ill individ ual would be an extraordinary intervention of state power into a personE2 8099s life, for what is likely to be small benefit. VSED is considered legal in the US. Several lower court decisions have been made in favor of a patientE28099s right to st op eating and drinking to hasten death (5), although there has not been a d efinitive higher court ruling. The American Nurses Association, the Interna tional Association of Hospice and Palliative Care, and the American Academy of Hospice & Palliative Medicine all consider VSED a legal option for  terminally ill patients to hasten their deaths (6-8). Given that VSED involves the expressed intention  of hastening death, some ethicists argue that even limited clinician partic ipation in VSED by providing counseling or managing symptoms is tantamount  to assisting with an immoral act (hastening death) and thus should not be d one (9,10). Others argue that while a clinician may judge VSED to be unethi cal, it is still important that clinicians continue to provide proper care  and palliation for patients dying due to VSED (11). Clinicians should not underestimate how complex a nd challenging caring for a patient who is pursuing VSED can be. Health car e organizations (e.g., nursing homes, hospice agencies) may not support a p atientE28099s decision for VSED due to ethical or legal/regulatory conce rns (12). Not all hospices will enroll patients pursuing VSED, especially i f the patient would not qualify for hospice without VSED (e.g., a patient w ith a terminal illness, but who likely would live longer than 6 months if t hey continued eating) (12). Clinicians who want to support a patient pursui ng VSED should be prepared to coordinate ethical, legal, and psychiatric in put. Responding to VSED Inquiries  See Fast Facts #156 and 159 which review the approach to requests for hastening death.  Essentially, a clinicianE28099s responsibility is to ensure that the dec ision is well-informed (based on accurate prognostic awareness); being made by a non-coerced patient with decision-making capacity (including that the patient is not incapacitated by a severe psychiatric illness such as depre ssion); and not stemming from treatable forms of suffering. Additionally, t he clinician should engage the patient in a thorough discussion of what VSE D looks like, including symptom burden, expected duration, and any alternat ives available to the patient (cessation of potentially life-prolonging med ical treatments, more aggressive symptom treatment, etc.). Given the signif icant cultural and emotional importance of eating and drinking, careful att ention should be paid to the patientE28099s legal surrogate decision mak er, family members, and other potential caregivers to provide education on  VSED. Patients should review and update any health care directive documents . When appropriate, clinicians should identify a hospice agency that will c are for patients engaging in VSED. Any clinician who feels that supporting  a patient wishing to engage in VSED would be violating their professional e thic should excuse themselves from the patientE28099s care and refer the m to a clinician who may be able to meet their need.",

    "title": "FF #397 Non-antipsychotics/Non-benzodiazepines in the Management of Agitated Delirium | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "May 1, 2020 Background Although their use rema ins commonplace, there is not strong evidence to support the use of antipsy chotics or benzodiazepines in the management of delirium (1-3). There are a lso barriers to the use of antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines in long-te rm care facilities. While prevention remains key in reducing morbidity from delirium, and nonpharmacologic interventions are the first-line treatments for active delirium, some patients will have distressing and potentially h armful manifestations of delirium such as severe agitation. This Fast F act will discuss the use of non-antipsychotics & non-benzodiazepin es in the management of agitated delirium. Much of the discussion is  targeted to hospitalized adult patients, because what few data exist have a ll emerged from this population. It is important to note that there i s currently no consensus about the role of any drug to treat delirium (outs ide of patients near the end-of-life, when sedation is acceptable) includin g the drugs mentioned here. Valproate (VPA) Rationale: VPA was developed as an anticonvulsant. It  is used in bipolar disease and acute mania (4). It affects dopamine, GABA,  and glutamate neurotransmission, all of which are implicated in the pathoge nesis of delirium (5). Evidence: There is lo w-quality evidence, from case series and retrospective reviews, that VPA re duces agitation in delirious patients when added to conventional treatments (6-8). No studies compare VPA with placebo in the management of agitated d elirium. Practical issues: The starting dose is between 500 mg to 1500 mg PO/IV a day in two to three dos es. The dose is increased according to the patientE28099s response usual ly by 250-500 mg/day every 1-3 days. Median dose in an ICU cohort was 1500  mg/d (8). VPA can be administered intravenously or as oral sprinkles for pa tients with dysphagia. It does not prolong the QT interval or aggravate par kinsonian symptoms (5). Melatonin Receptor Agonists (Melatonin and Ramelteon):  see Fast Fact #306 Rationale: Melatonin  regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Increasing levels of melatonin at dark faci litate sleep initiation and maintenance (9). Low levels of melatonin and/or lack of melatonin rhythmicity are associated with delirium (10). Evidence: There is lo w-quality evidence, from retrospective studies and case series, suggesting  the efficacy of melatonin and ramelteon in the management of delirium (11-1 3). No randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the use of melatonin and ramelteon with placebo in the management of delirium. Some authors support the use of melatonin receptor agonists to prevent delirium (9), h owever, systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs have not shown consist ent benefit nor side effects (10,14,15). Practical issues: Alt hough the supporting evidence is limited, melatonin receptor agonists can b e considered in patients with delirium when there is a circadian rhythm dis turbance (16). Melatonin 0.5, 2, 5, 6, or 10 mg at bedtime were prescribed  in the cases reported (11,12,16). Ramelteon is a synthetic analog of melato nin that has a longer half-life and a higher affinity for melatonin recepto rs. The studied ramelteon dose is 8 mg at bedtime. Dexmedetomidine (DXM): see Fast Fact #280. Rationale: DXM is an  alpha(CEB1)-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used as a sedative in ICU patie nts. It does not affect the respiratory drive or arousal state. DXM decreas es the need for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agents, benzodiazepines, and opioids that are associated with delirium (17). Evidence: Studies of  delirium prevention in the ICU setting support this use of DXM (14 ). In one well-designed, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled stu dy (18), DXM demonstrated efficacy to treat delirium in intubated  patients, reducing the time to extubation compared to placebo. < /p> Practical issues: Mai n side effects are hypotension and bradycardia which are severe enough ofte n to restrict its use to the ICU. It has a modest analgesic effect. DXM is  also quite expensive. Clonidine and Guanfacine Rationale: Both medic ations are also CEB1-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. They have similar pr operties to DXM, but a lesser impact on systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, and heart rate and therefore do not require ICU monitoring. Guan facine is more specific for the CEB12A-subtype receptor than clonidine. B ecause of this, it is more sedating and has less analgesic effect compared  to clonidine (25). Evidence: A pilot stu dy suggested a clonidine infusion could reduce the severity of delirium aft er surgery for type A aortic dissection (19). A well-designed, double-blind RCT comparing enteral clonidine against placebo in delirious, hospitalized older patients did not demonstrate any benefit, although the trial failed  to recruit adequate subjects and was under-powered (21). Unfortunately, the re are no good, controlled data on guanfacine; however, case series and ret rospective analyses suggest it is well-tolerated, affordable, and it may be effective at managing hyperactive delirium (26,27). Practical issues: Clo nidine is available in oral and transdermal routes. It has analgesic proper ties as well. Abrupt cessation of clonidine causes rebound hypertension (22 ). Guanfacine is only available orally. Experts recommend a dose range of 0 .5 to 4 mg/day depending upon severity of symptoms. It also is associ ated with a withdrawal syndrome, though likely less pronounced compared to  DXM or clonidine. Cholinesterase inhibitors: see Fast Fact #174< /p> Rationale: A deficit  of acetylcholine is associated with delirium. Cholinesterase inhibitors use d in AlzheimerE28099s disease (e.g., donepezil, galantamine) increase th e availability of acetylcholine (23). Evidence: Cholinergic agents such as physostigmine, galantamine, and donepezil are used to treat delirium from anticholinergic poisoning (23). A systematic review of seven RCTs that evaluated the role of cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine an d donepezil) in the treatment or prevention of delirium in older adults, di d not find any meaningful benefit (24). Practical issues: Nau sea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common side effects for this medication cla ss. Summary Of the above-mentioned drugs, onl y DXM has high quality evidence supporting its use, albeit in a narrow popu lation (agitated patients on ventilators). Other drug classes need addition al research before their clinical applicability is understood. & nbsp;",

    "summary": "November 13, 2021 Background: E2809C We are praying for a miracle. E2809D E2809CItE28099s in GodE28099s hands.E2809D E2809CO nly God knows.E2809D These statements likely  sound familiar to any clinician who has cared for a patient with a serious  illness. Yet even the most experienced clinicians may feel caught off- guard when patients and families use religious- or spiritual-based coping t o guide healthcare decisions. This Fast Fact assimi lates published evidence and expert opinion to offer a paradigm for respond ing to patients or families who express hope for a miracle. Recognize that spiritual beliefs commonly affect decision-making in a variety of ways : Spiritual and religious practice s often impact decision-making, goals, and values (1). Even within the same faith or belief community, the implications of a given religious beli ef vary substantially (1). Hence, patients can imply vastly different meani ngs when they use spiritually based language. For example, when a patient s tates that they do not wish to E2809C give up hope for a miracle  ,E2809D that patient may be requesting that the clinician E2809C d o everything E2809D possible to help them live longer no matter the  medical burden. For others, such words convey a wish to delay or discontinu e standard treatment in favor of holistic or spiritual healing. Begin with curiosity and seek clarity: Clinicians  should take the stance of a curious explorer who seeks to know more about a patientE28099s belief. A statement such as, E2809C This is in God E28099s hands ,E2809D can be an opportunity for clinicians to und erstand the patient and their illness perspective better. It is essential t o remain non-judgmental and use open-ended responses such as: E2809C  Tell me more about what that looks like for you.E2809D The sam e exploratory framework applies to statements about hope and miracles: E2 809C Can you tell me more about what you are hoping for ?E2809D or E2809C What does a miracle look like for you ?E2809D This  acknowledges the patientE28099s spirituality as a source of strength and peace, while helping the clinician to offer more individualized guidance.< /p> Align with their hopes for a miracle: Aligni ng with the patient involves naming your willingness to hope alongside them (2): E2809CI hope for a miraculous cure for your cancer as wel l.E2809D Use E2809C and E2809D instead of E280 9C but E2809D when holding two contrasting ideas together, to av oid negating hope: E2809CI know these goals are important to yo u, and I also worry that time may be short.E2809D  Clinicians can validate the desire for a miraculous outcome, while inv iting discussion of additional hopes if their illness is not cured  ;( e.g., family reconciliation, a deeper faith practice, participating  in an important life-cycle event, choosing the location of dying). Explore how miracles impact their point of view: & nbsp;If a patient feels that God has healed their disease in the past, they may hope for GodE28099s healing again and request medical treatment acc ordingly (3). Clinicians should acknowledge past experiences, while explori ng how the current situation may be different: E2809CI think it E28099s wonderful that your mom has lived so long with this disease, des pite many hospitalizations. I also worry if her situation is changing, and we may be in a different place now.E2809D Clinicians ofte n worry that patients who are hoping for a miracle lack insight into the se riousness of their underlying illness. However, hoping for a medical miracl e can be a proportionate coping mechanism that implies a certain level of c linical insight; otherwise, that patient likely would not feel the need to  hope for one. To preserve hope, while acknowledging the clinical situation, language such as E2809C hoping for the best, preparing for the worst E2809D has been recommended (4). Enlist the expertise of a clinical chaplain: Board certified chaplains (see Fast Fact #347) explore spirit ual distress, anticipatory grief, and sources of meaning for patients and f amilies of all belief systems, including agnostic or non-religious patients (5). Evidence suggests chaplaincy involvement leads to better communicatio n and a more nuanced understanding of how spirituality and faith affects ca re decisions (6). Religiously observant patients who receive spiritual supp ort from an IDT that includes a chaplain are less likely to seek intensive  end-of-life interventions and die in the ICU than religious patients who re ceive spiritual support only from their faith communities (6). The AMEN Protocol : A group of experts publis hed this acronym to help clinicians navigate expressions of hope for a mira cle within their scope of practice, while respecting faith and culture (7). Affirm the patientE2 8099s belief and validate his or her position: E2809C Ms. X, I am h opeful that your spouse makes a full medical recovery, too .E2809D Meet the patient or family member where they a re: E2809C I join you in hoping for a miracle.E2809D  Educate from your role as a clinician: E2809C < u>And I want to speak to you about some medical issues.E2809D E2809CNo matter whatE2809D : This is an a ffirmatory statement of non-abandonment to assure the patient and family yo u are committed to them regardless of how their illness evolves: E2809C< em>No matter what happens, we will be with you every step of the way .

    "title": "FF #60 Pharmacologic Management of Delirium: Update on Newer Agents | Palliative Care Network of Wisconsin",
    "summary": "January 29, 2019 Background Delirium is common in those with serious medical illness. There may be underlying physiologic ca uses to delirium and it can be categorized as hyperactive, hypoactive, or m ixed. Common reversible etiologies include infections, constipat ion, urinary retention, medications, electrolyte abnormalities, and sleep d eprivation. Initial management strategies should include identifying and tr eating the underlying cause, as well as non-pharmacological treatment.  ; However, when these strategies are not effective, pharmacological in terventions may be necessary to ensure patient and staff safety.  ;This Fast Fact identifies pharmacologic pearls regardin g the management of a reversible, hyperactive delirium. See Fast F act #1 for more information on terminal delirium. 1 st Generation Antipsychotics Haloperidol (Haldol) Although no medication has been FDA ap proved for the treatment of delirium, haloperidol is most commonly used sin ce it can be administered safely through oral, subcutaneous, and parenteral routes. Starting doses are 0.5 E28093 1 mg PO/SC/IV. &n bsp;Titration can occur by 2 E28093 5 mg every 1 hour as needed until a  total daily requirement is established, which is then administered in daily or twice daily doses. Recommended maximum dose is 100 mg/day.&n bsp; IV or SC haloperidol may cause less extrapyramidal symptoms than  oral but may cause more significant QTc prolongation. Chlorprom azine (Thorazine) has more sedative effects than haloperido l for patients in whom sedation is desired. The starting dose is 25 E28093 50 mg PO or IV. Titration can occur by 25 E280 93 50 mg every 1 hour until a total daily requirement is established, whic h is then administered in daily or twice daily doses. Slow titra tion is recommended for IV doing. Maximum dose is 2000 mg/day. 2 nd Generation Antipsychotics & nbsp; Also known as atypical antipsychotics, no evidence currently  exists for improved efficacy with 2nd generation antipsychotics, so they ar e not considered to be first-line treatment. Still, these agents are associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects than 1st generation  antipsychotics, hence, in patients with a history of extrapyramidal reactio ns from 1st generation antipsychotics this class of agents may be preferred . For acutely agitated patients requiring onset of action within minutes, p roviders should know that these agents do not work as fast as conventional  antipsychotics. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) The star ting daily dose is 2.5-5 mg PO. It is often given at night. After one week, the dose can be raised to 10 mg a day; then 20 mg a day. Orally disintegrating tablets (Zydis) are available. It has shown effectiveness f or chemotherapy-induced nausea (see Fast Fact #315). Quetiapine (Seroquel) is initially given 25 mg PO once o r twice a day which can be raised by 25 E28093 50 mg per dose every 2  E28093 3 days. Compared to the atypical neuroleptics, it has the least e xtrapyramidal side effects, but has more orthostasis and sedative potential s. It is the antipsychotic of choice for patient with ParkinsonE28099s D isease or Lewy Body Dementia. Risperidone &nb sp; (Resperidal) is given 1 E28093 2 mg PO at night and is gradu ally raised 1 mg every 2 E28093 3 days until an effective dose (usually  4 E28093 6 mg PO) is reached. It has minimal anticholinergic  effects and does not cause orthostasis. It is the least sedating of this class of antipsychotics Aripiprazole (Abilif y) initially 2 mg daily PO (tablet, solution, disintegrating), repeat dosin g every 4-6 hours as needed to a maximum of 15 mg/day. Least likely to prol ong QTc in retrospective studies. It has less sedation and extrapyramidal s ide effects but may cause orthostasis. It does not need dose adjustments in renal or hepatic failure. Risks The FDA has issued a black -box warning about the increased risk of death and stroke when first- or se cond-generation antipsychotics are used to treat dementia-related psychosis in elderly patients. This warning is based on limited studies which have n ot been replicated and do not address the short-term use of antipsychotics  to manage delirium especially in terminally ill patients. Since, delirium is a poor prognostic marker, goals of care and values must be dis cussed and taken into account regarding the medical management of delirium. Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines can make del irium worse and precipitate withdrawal syndromes. Hence, unless the patient is acutely dying, and sedation is preferred; the patientE28099s agitati on is severe and uncontrolled; the patient is withdrawing from benzodiazepi nes or alcohol; or suffering from anticholinergic excess, benzodiazepines s hould be avoided for potentially reversible forms of delirium. Melatonin This hormone is produc ed naturally in the pineal gland and can help regulate the sleep-wake rhyth m cycle. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have validated the use of mel atonin and a melatonin analog (ramelteon) in the prevention of delirium for at-risk, hospitalized patients. See Fast Fact &nbs p;#306. Discharge Prior to discharge it is important to re concile medications and discontinue antipsychotics once delirium has resolv ed.",
